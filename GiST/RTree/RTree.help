This is a test program for the Generalized Search Tree (GiST), as
described by Hellerstein, Naughton & Pfeffer in Proceedings of the
21st International Conference on Very Large Database Systems.

The following commands are understood:

create rtree foo         Creates and opens a new r-tree named foo

open rtree foo           Opens an existing r-tree foo

close foo                Closes the rtree foo

drop x                   Drops (deletes) the table foo

select from foo          Selects (displays) all entries in foo

select from foo where key <op> (<xlo>, <xhi>, <ylo>, <yhi>) 
                         Selects entries in foo based on comparison with
			 a bounding box.  The comparison operators
                         that can be used in place of <op> are =
                         (equals), & (overlaps), < (contained-in), and
                         > (contains).  The four coordinates of 
                         the key are (xlow, xhigh, ylow, yhigh) of the
                         query box, which are all of type double.

insert foo ((0,1.2,0,1), 4)   Inserts a new entry with key (0,1.2,0,1), 
                         pointer 4 into table foo.  

delete foo ((0,0,0,0), 4)   deletes an entry with key (0,0,0,0), pointer 4
                         from table foo

debug                    Activate debugging output

help                     Display this screen

dump foo                 Dump tree foo to the screen. 

quit                     Quit the program
