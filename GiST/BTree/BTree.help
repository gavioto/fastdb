This is a test program for the Generalized Search Tree (GiST), as
described by Hellerstein, Naughton & Pfeffer in Proceedings of the
21st International Conference on Very Large Database Systems.

The following commands are understood:

create btree foo         Creates and opens a new b-tree named foo

open btree foo           Opens an existing btree foo

close foo                Closes the btree foo

drop x                   Drops (deletes) the table foo

select from foo          Selects (displays) all entries in foo

select from foo where key < 9 and key > 4
                         Selects and entres in foo that are
                         between 4 and 9 exclusively

insert foo ("gary", 4)   Inserts a new entry with key "gary", pointer 4
                         into table foo

delete foo ("gary", 4)   deletes an entry with key "gary", pointer 4
                         from table foo

debug                    Activate debugging output

help                     Display this screen

dump foo                 Dump tree foo to the screen. 

quit                     Quit the program
