/**
 * This class is used as interface to local or remote database (through RMI).
 * In case of local connections you should create instance of DatabaseJNI class directly.
 * In case of remote connection, it is necessary to create instance of DatabaseSessionClient
 * class and path reference to the stub object implementing DatabaseSession interface.<p>
 * Methods of this interface are mostly one-to-one mapped to methods of C++ dbDatabase class.
 * In case of remote application, it should either open or create new database at server using Database.open method,
 * either attach to the existing database using Database.attach method. In case of local application,
 * Database.attach should be used by all application threads except one opened the database.<p>
 * All database access errors are reported by means of CliException. In case of remote database there are
 * also can be exceptions related with server communication.
